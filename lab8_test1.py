Takes a list and compares all of the items on the list with each other,
the list is supposed to be a list of the trig functions, so I call the 
equal method to see if the items(trig functions) are equal to each other.

#Number 2
"""
This method takes a list of numbers and is supposed to split it into two different
sets, which have to have the same sum, and add up to the sum of the inital list.
I used the subsetsum function to get a subset with the sum of half of the sum
of the original list provided. I then took everything from the original list that
wasn't in the new list made with the subsetsum and added it to a blank list.
Lastly I compared the sums of the two lists to see if they are a match, then I
return the two lists.
